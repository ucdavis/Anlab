<div class="col">
  <p>The UC Davis Analytical Lab strives to meet its clients’ turnaround time requirements. The Lab’s current turnaround times are variable. In fairness to all submitters, samples are processed in the order received by the Lab.</p>

  <p>If your analytical results require an expedited time frame, please contact the <a href="mailto:anlab@ucdavis.edu">Lab Office</a>, (530) 752-0147, prior to sample submission to ensure that your request can be accommodated. Rush requests are reviewed and approved based on the laboratory’s resources and workload at the time of the request. </p>

<p>Requests to rush samples are subject to additional charges ranging from 1.5x to 4x of the original listed price</p>
