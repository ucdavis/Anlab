    Update posted: May 21, 2020<br /><br />
       We are close to full operational status at the lab now and receiving hours will return to normal (daily 8am to 5pm) on May 26th.
         If you are dropping off samples at receiving and would prefer to stay outside, you can knock on the door or give Gary a 
        call at 530-752-0266 and he will push a cart outside the door to take your samples and paperwork. 
        We do have hand sanitizer available in the receiving area. <br /><br />
    <br /><br />
    Thank you for your patience during this time of changing circumstances.
