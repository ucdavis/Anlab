        We are scaling back to a bare minimum staff at this time.  We will only be working on samples where immediate testing is essential.  Assisting you with your research is very important to us and we are eager to return to full staffing as soon as it is safe.<br /> <br />
    For the week of April 6-10, receiving will be open from 9am to noon.<br /><br />
    Starting April 13th for sample drop-off please email us at <a href="mailto:anlab@ucdavis.edu">anlab@ucdavis.edu</a> to arrange a time to meet at receiving.  If you need to ship samples to us, please email us with the expected delivery date.<br /><br />
    Please use this option for samples requiring immediate testing for essential research.  We can also arrange for receipt of more routine samples if proper storage of samples cannot be arranged in your own facility as we await a return to normal business operations.<br /><br />
    Please monitor our homepage for updates and thank you for your patience!<br /><br />
    Please be safe.
