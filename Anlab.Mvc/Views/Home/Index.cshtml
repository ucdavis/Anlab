       We are continuing to work with limited staffing to comply with physical distancing for safety.  The Receiving Area is 
        currently open for sample submission from 9am to noon.  If you need to drop samples off outside of these hours, please 
        email the lab at anlab@ucdavis.edu to arrange a drop-off time.  Please continue to email us with the expected delivery 
        date if you ship samples.<br /><br />
    As time passes, samples previously submitted and not considered critical for immediate analysis may become more important 
        to your research.  Please do not hesitate to email us at anlab@ucdavis.edu to let us know your needs.  We hope to be able 
        to increase staffing levels soon.<br /><br />
    Please monitor our home page for updates and thank you for your patience!<br /><br />
    Please be safe.
